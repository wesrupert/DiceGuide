      <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).</text>
      <text>With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</text>
      <text>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.</text>
      <text>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.</text>
      <text>In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.</text>
      <text>A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.</text>

      <text>Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</text>

          <name>Rage</name>
          <text>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</text>
          <text>While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor.</text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>&#8226; You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</text>
          <text>&#8226; When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian.  At 1st level, you have a +2 bonus to damage.  Your bonus increases to +3 at 9th level and to +4 at 16th.</text>
          <text>&#8226; You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</text>
          <text>Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</text>
          <text>Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.  You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.</text>

When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</text>

          <name>Danger Sense</name>
          <text>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</text>

        </feature>
        <feature optional="YES">
          <name>Path of the Berserker</name>
          <text>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end &#8212; that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</text>
        </feature>
        <feature optional="YES">
          <name>Frenzy (Path of the Berserker)</name>
          <text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.</text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>Exhaustion:</text>
          <text>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>Level &#8212; Effect:</text>
          <text>1 &#8212;Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
          <text>2 &#8212;Speed halved</text>
          <text>3 &#8212;Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>
          <text>4 &#8212;Hit point maximum halved</text>
          <text>5 &#8212;Speed reduced to 0</text>
          <text>6 &#8212;Death</text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
          <text>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
          <text>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>
          <text>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</text>

        <feature optional="YES">
          <name>Path of the Totem Warrior</name>
          <text>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.</text>
          <text>Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</text>

        <feature optional="YES">
          <name>Spirit Seeker (Path of the Totem Warrior)</name>
          <text>Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals, as described in chapter 10.</text>
        </feature>
        <feature optional="YES">
          <name>Totem Spirit (Path of the Totem Warrior)</name>
          <text>At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar adornment &#8212; that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or b ones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</text>
          <text>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</text>
