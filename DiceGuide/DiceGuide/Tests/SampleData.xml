      <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).</text>
      <text>With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</text>
      <text>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.</text>
      <text>One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.</text>
      <text>In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.</text>
      <text>A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.</text>

      <text>Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</text>

The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.</text>

          <name>Rage</name>
          <text>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</text>
          <text>While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor.</text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>&#8226; You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</text>
          <text>&#8226; When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian.  At 1st level, you have a +2 bonus to damage.  Your bonus increases to +3 at 9th level and to +4 at 16th.</text>
          <text>&#8226; You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</text>
          <text>Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</text>
          <text>Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.  You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.</text>

          <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</text>
        </feature>
        <feature>
          <name>Danger Sense</name>
          <text>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</text>
          <text>You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</text>

          <text>At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior.</text>
        </feature>
        <feature optional="YES">
          <name>Path of the Berserker</name>
          <text>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end &#8212; that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</text>
        </feature>
        <feature optional="YES">
          <name>Frenzy (Path of the Berserker)</name>
          <text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.</text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>Exhaustion:</text>
          <text>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>Level &#8212; Effect:</text>
          <text>1 &#8212;Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
          <text>2 &#8212;Speed halved</text>
          <text>3 &#8212;Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>
          <text>4 &#8212;Hit point maximum halved</text>
          <text>5 &#8212;Speed reduced to 0</text>
          <text>6 &#8212;Death</text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
          <text>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
          <text>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>
          <text>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</text>
        </feature>
        <feature optional="YES">
          <name>Path of the Totem Warrior</name>
          <text>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.</text>
          <text>Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</text>

        <feature optional="YES">
          <name>Spirit Seeker (Path of the Totem Warrior)</name>
          <text>Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals, as described in chapter 10.</text>
        </feature>
        <feature optional="YES">
          <name>Totem Spirit (Path of the Totem Warrior)</name>
          <text>At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar adornment &#8212; that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or b ones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</text>
          <text>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</text>

          <text>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.</text>

          <text>Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</text>

          <name>Spellcasting</name>
          <text>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list. </text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
          <text>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
          <text>You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier+half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
          <text>For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
          <text>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. </text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
          <text>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
          <text>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
          <text>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier </text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
          <text>You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</text>
        </feature>
        <feature>
          <name>Divine Smite</name>
          <text>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.</text>

The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</text>

          <name>Oath of Devotion</name>
          <text>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels &#8212; the perfect servants of good &#8212; as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms. </text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>Tenets of Devotion:</text>
          <text>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</text>
          <text>Honesty. Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.</text>
          <text>Courage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</text>
          <text>Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.</text>
          <text>Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.</text>
          <text>Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you. </text>

The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.</text>

          <text>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions.

        <feature optional="YES">
          <name>Oath of the Ancients</name>
          <text>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things &#8212; leaves, antlers, or flowers &#8212; to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world. </text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>Tenets of the Ancients:</text>
          <text>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple. </text>
          <text>Kindle the Light.</text>
          <text>Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair. </text>
          <text>Shelter the Light.</text>
          <text>Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren. </text>
          <text>Preserve Your Own Light.</text>
          <text>Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world. </text>
          <text>Be the Light.</text>
          <text>Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds. </text>

          <text>You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.</text>

          <text>If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</text>
        </feature>
        <feature optional="YES">
          <name>Oath of Vengeance</name>
          <text>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside &#8212; at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins &#8212;  sometimes called avengers or dark knights &#8212; their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.</text>
          <text> </text>
          <text>Tenets of Vengeance:</text>
          <text>The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple. </text>
